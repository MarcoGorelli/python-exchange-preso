        # Stability: building on top of Narwhals

        Narwhals takes backwards-compatibility very seriously.

        We currently expose two namespaces:
        - `import narwhals as nw`. Maybe subject to changes / deprecation cycles.
        - `import narwhals.stable.v1 as nw`. Not expected to ever change (so long as that's possible).

        Suggestion:
        - prototype / explore using `import narwhals as nw`. When you're happy, trying switching over to `import narwhals.stable.v1 as nw`, and if it still works, deploy your tool with confidence that new Narwhals releases won't break it! ðŸš€
